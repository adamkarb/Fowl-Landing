Its wide range has given rise to several distinct populations. The male mallard's white neck-ring separates the green head from the chestnut-brown chest, contrasts with the gray sides, brownish back, black rump and black upper- and under-tail coverts. The speculum is violet-blue bordered by black and white, and the outer tail feathers are white. The bill is yellow to yellowish-green and the legs and feet are coral-red. Male utters a soft, rasping 'kreep.' The female mallard is a mottled brownish color and has a violet speculum bordered by black and white. The crown of the head is dark brown with a dark brown stripe running through the eye. The remainder of the head is lighter brown than the upper body. The bill is orange splotched with brown, and the legs and feet are orange. Female is especially vocal with the characteristic series of quacks."},{image:"https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTnMGfZjpTbWnt5yXTQVhkPQpEJ9xbNDODzcBgl-h2JBgayrJPKmQ",name:"Black Duck",description:"Black ducks are similar to mallards in size, and resemble the female mallard in coloration, though the black duck's plumage is darker. The male and female black duck are similar in appearance, but the male's bill is yellow while the female's is a dull green. The head is slightly lighter brown than the dark brown body, and the speculum is iridescent violet-blue with predominantly black margins. In flight, the white underwings can be seen in contrast to the dark brown body. The American black duck breeds from the upper Mississippi River across to the northeastern United States, north through northern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, across Ontario and the eastern Canadian provinces. The highest breeding densities are found in Maine and Nova Scotia."},{image:"http://www.grizzlyranchconservancy.org/images/green_winged_teal_duck.jpg",name:"Green Winged Teal",description:'Green-winged teal are the smallest of our North American ducks with a short neck and small bill.

It has a dark body, lighter head and neck, orange legs and dark eyes. Both sexes have a shiny green-blue speculum (wing patch), which is not bordered with white as with the mallard. Males and females are similar, but the male's bill is bright yellow, whereas the female's is deep to pale orange, occasionally lined with black splotches around the edges and near the base.The plumage is darker than in female mallards, especially at the tail. In flight, the lack of a white border to the speculum is a key difference. The American black duck is darker than most mottled ducks, and its wing-patch is more purple than blue. The behaviour and voice are the same as the mallard. Mottled ducks feed by dabbling in shallow water, and grazing on land. They mainly eat plants, but also some mollusks and aquatic insects. The ducks are fairly common within their restricted range; they are resident all-year round and do not migrate. The breeding habitat is coastal marshes. The nest is built on the ground amongst vegetation, such as bull-rush and marsh grass."},{image:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Er4ggMc6OBo/UKABS8GxhRI/AAAAAAAACMQ/WBR6lUeiQC4/s1600/IMG_0741.jpg",name:"Gadwall",description:'Gadwalls are medium-sized ducks characterized by a general lack of bright coloration.
